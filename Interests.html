  <p> I have a lot of hobbies. I really like just spending time with my friends.</p>
  <p> While I'm not taking any classes for it, my favorite pass time is</p>
  <p> philosophy. I spend a lot of time thinking up philosophical ideals.</p>
  <p> I also play a lot of video games, however, I've played a lot less here</p>
  <p> at college. My favorites are either rpg's or multiplayer games I can play</p>
  <p> with my friends on the PC. I also spend a bunch of time on youtube looking</p>
  <p> up videos or finding music. music is very important to me, and I'll listen to</p>
  <p> a lot of different genre's. I listen to rock, metal, electronic, synthwave,</p>
  <p> outlaw country, classical, old school rock, movie/game soundtracks,</p>
  <p> etc. But I do have a few genre's I will not listen to; generic country</p>
  <p> and rap. I really don't know what I want to do when I finish college</p>
  <p> but if I continue pursuing computer science, I'm sure I'll find a job in</p>
  <p> that department, I already know some people in that category.</p>
