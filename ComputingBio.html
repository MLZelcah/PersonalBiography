<p> Prior to college, I had nearly zero experience in the computer science</p>
<p> department. However I knew I enjoyed the subject very much and couldn't</p>
<p> decide on any other good major so I entered this major. Howver I now have</p>
<p> some experience. I've taken one semester learning about C++ and understanding</p>
<p> the fundamentals of it. I've now stepped back and learning some of the</p>
<p> more basic principles in my current computer science class.</p>
