  <p> Hello, my name is Michael Lewis, but I go by Steven.</p>
  <p> That's my middle name, I go by it because my dad is also Michael.</p>
  <p> I major in Computer Science and if all goes perfect, I'll graduate</p>
  <p> in 2020. I'm still not sure if computer science is the way to go<p>
  <p> but I enjoy it. I play a lot of video games and love computers.</p>
  <p> I also like to hang out with friends and listen to music. </p>
